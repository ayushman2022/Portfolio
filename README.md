## Lessons Learned

**What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

- While building MyPortfolio, I deepened my understanding of responsive web design, optimizing layouts for various devices using HTML and CSS. I also honed my skills in JavaScript to add interactive elements, like smooth scrolling and dynamic navigation. 

- One significant challenge was ensuring cross-browser compatibility. I encountered inconsistencies in how different browsers rendered CSS properties. To overcome this, I extensively tested the website on multiple browsers and used CSS resets and vendor prefixes to maintain uniformity.

- Another challenge was optimizing performance. High-quality images initially slowed down the site, so I used image compression techniques and lazy loading to improve load times. 

- Balancing aesthetics with functionality was a learning curve; iterating on design and user feedback helped me create a visually appealing yet efficient portfolio. This project enhanced my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of thorough testing and optimization in web development.
